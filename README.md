# Linear-Regression-with-python
Implemented linear regression to predict the prices of houses.
Suppose you are selling your house and you want to know what a good market price would be. One way to do this is to first collect information on recent houses sold and make a model of housing prices. The housingprices.csv contains a training set of housing prices in Port land, Oregon. The first column is the size of the house (in square feet), and second column is the price of the house.
